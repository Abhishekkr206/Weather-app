## About

This web app allows you to search any city and instantly get details like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. The app also has a Minecraft-style dynamic background that changes based on the weather. If it's sunny, you see a bright Minecraft world. If it's raining, snowing, misty, or cloudy, the scene updates accordingly. This makes the weather checking experience more engaging.

It is built using HTML for structure, CSS for the Minecraft-style UI, and JavaScript to fetch and display live weather data from the API.
