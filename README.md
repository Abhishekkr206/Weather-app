About: 
This is a Weather App where you can quickly check the current weather for any city. You just type in a city, and it gives you the temperature, humidity, and weather conditions instantly.
The best part? It has a Minecraft-themed background that changes based on the weather. So, if it's sunny, you'll see a bright Minecraft world, and if it's raining, the app will show a rainy Minecraft scene. It makes checking the weather more fun!
I built it using HTML for the layout, CSS for the Minecraft-style design, and JavaScript to fetch live weather data from an API. It's simple to use, visually cool, and gives you accurate weather updates.
